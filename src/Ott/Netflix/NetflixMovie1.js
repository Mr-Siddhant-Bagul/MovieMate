The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful." />

All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb." />

But let's be fair, it's a very good series. I've watched a few movies about it. The script was good. Acting was sometimes exaggerated, maybe it's a cultural thing. I did not like the final part. Overall very well done. In the final episode, my expectation was different. But the final scene was disappointing. Season 2 will come." />
